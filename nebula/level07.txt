the files listed there are:
index.cgi    -rwxr-xr-x
thttpd.conf  -rw-r--r--

have no idea about this challenge, check the sulution here:
https://github.com/1u4nx/Exploit-Exercises-Nebula/blob/master/Level07%E2%80%94%E2%80%94Perl%E8%84%9A%E6%9C%AC%E5%8F%AF%E6%89%A7%E8%A1%8C%E4%BB%BB%E6%84%8F%E6%96%87%E4%BB%B6%E6%BC%8F%E6%B4%9E.md

tried
wget -O- http://127.0.0.1:7007/index.cgi?Host=localhost;getflag

it is not executed as flag07
use 
wget -O- http://127.0.0.1:7007/index.cgi?Host=localhost;whoami
it is level07

From what we did in previous challenge, we know that ";" is used to seperate commands.
the outputs above are caused by:
127.0.0.1:7007?Host=localhost is taken as param
; seperate the command
getflag/whoami
is executed by current user

We want the commands to be executed by flag07.
To achieve this goal, we should pass "127.0.0.1:7007?Host=localhost;getflag" as a string in url
To solve this
the ";" should not be taken as ";" in shell but as ";" in URL

If you have ever noticed the urls in web browser or have any web experience, you should know the non-numeric/non-letter characers can be coded in URL

to find the corresponding code of ";" in url
http://www.w3schools.com/tags/html_form_submit.asp?text=%3B
it is %3B

use
127.0.0.1?Host=localhost%3Bgetflag
it is successfully executed as flag07
