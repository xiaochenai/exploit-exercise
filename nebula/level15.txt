Tip: to scroll up in tty: SHIFT+PAGEUP
As suggested, run strace /home/flag15/flag15
it looks like the program is looking for lib:
libc.so.6

a straight forward idea is to create libc.so.6 in /tmp folder and tell the program where the lib is.
from here: http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/shared-libraries-linux-gcc.html
we can find three different ways and from here: http://linux.die.net/man/3/dlopen
it says: 
	"If, at the time that the program was started, the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH was defined to contain a colon-separated list of directories, then these are searched. (As a security measure this variable is ignored for set-user-ID and set-group-ID programs.)
	"

in /tmp folder make a shared library called libc.so.6 (see level15-1 for the source)
and
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/libc.so.6:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
and run strace /home/flag15/flag15

it does't work
return messages:
	a relocation error, symbol system -- version GLIBC_2.0 not defined in libc.so.6 
	no version information available

because "As a security measure this variable is ignored for set-user-ID and set-group-ID programs"
We probably need to work on rpath instead of LD_LIBRARY_PATH (I didn't notice it before).

After searching for a while, it seems not easy to change the rpath for a compiled file (the rpath example in the ref above is applied when compiling a file)

After review the result of our first run again, it seems we can copy/create the lib file inside /var/tmp/flag15
																								/var/tmp/flag15/tls/....
																								/var/tmp/flag15/sse2/....
																							we can create libc.so.6 in any of these folder

run /home/flag15/flag15

It gives the same error as before

a relocation error, symbol system -- version GLIBC_2.0 not defined in libc.so.6 (this may caused by function/variable/tag/... name not founded)
no version information available

We can use LD_DEBUG to debug and find the stop point
