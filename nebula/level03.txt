There is a crontab that is called every couple of minutes.

google "crontab"
ref1:http://www.computerhope.com/unix/ucrontab.htm


The crontab is a list of commands that you want to run on a regular schedule, and also the name of the command used to manage that list.

format 
m h  dom mon dow   command

A number (or list of numbers, or range of numbers), m, representing the minute of the hour;
A number (or list of numbers, or range of numbers), h, representing the hour of the day;
A number (or list of numbers, or range of numbers), dom, representing the day of the month;
A number (or list, or range), or name (or list of names), mon, representing the month of the year;
A number (or list, or range), or name (or list of names), dow, representing the day of the week; and
command, which is the command to be run, exactly as it would appear on the command line.

A "list of numbers" is a set of integers separated by commas, for example 15,30,45, which would represent just those three numbers. A "range of numbers" is a set of numbers separated by a hyphen, for example 10-20, which would represent all the numbers from 10 through 20, inclusive.

To view your crontab, you can use this command:

try to find the files in /var/spool/cron/crontabs

sudo vi /var/spool/cron/crontabs/flag03

find
