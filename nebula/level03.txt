There is a crontab that is called every couple of minutes.

google "crontab"
ref1:http://www.computerhope.com/unix/ucrontab.htm


The crontab is a list of commands that you want to run on a regular schedule, and also the name of the command used to manage that list.

format 
m h  dom mon dow   command

A number (or list of numbers, or range of numbers), m, representing the minute of the hour;
A number (or list of numbers, or range of numbers), h, representing the hour of the day;
A number (or list of numbers, or range of numbers), dom, representing the day of the month;
A number (or list, or range), or name (or list of names), mon, representing the month of the year;
A number (or list, or range), or name (or list of names), dow, representing the day of the week; and
command, which is the command to be run, exactly as it would appear on the command line.

A "list of numbers" is a set of integers separated by commas, for example 15,30,45, which would represent just those three numbers. A "range of numbers" is a set of numbers separated by a hyphen, for example 10-20, which would represent all the numbers from 10 through 20, inclusive.

To view your crontab, you can use this command:
ref2:http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-show-what-cron-jobs-are-setup/

crontab -v

	no result

less /etc/crontab

	no useful info

notice this in the ref2
"The cron service searches its spool area (usually /var/spool/cron/crontabs) for crontab files (which are named after user accounts); "

try to find the files in /var/spool/cron/crontabs
but level03 is denied
login as nebula

sudo vi /var/spool/cron/crontabs/flag03

find

"*/3 * * * * /home/flag03/writable.sh"

*/3 means every 3 minutes, read ref1

ls /home/flag03

find 2 files: writable.d and writable.sh

in the file:
	for i in /home/flag03/writable.d/*; do
		(ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
		rm -f "$i"
	done
bash scripting
ref3:http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html

use 'man ulimit' to find more info about ulimit
use 'man bash' to find more info about bash
'bash -x' the '-x' option is used to enable debug

Bash reads and executes commands from this file, then exits.

so to solve this problem, we should create a file in writable.d which will help us to run /bin/getflag

open the directory
'vi get'
write script to the file
	!#/bin/sh
	echo hello
	/bin/getflag
then save and exit

update: use 'ln' to link /bin/getflag to another file
	!#/bin/sh
	echo hello > /tmp/xiao
	/home/flag03/writable.d/run > /tmp/hello

dont work, nothing print out

after review the solution from here:https://github.com/1u4nx/Exploit-Exercises-Nebula/blob/master/Level03%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E5%88%A9%E7%94%A8%E8%AE%A1%E5%88%92%E4%BB%BB%E5%8A%A1%E6%8F%90%E6%9D%83.md

change to script to
	!#/bin/sh
	echo hello > /tmp/xiao
	/bin/getflag > /tmp/xiao

open /tmp/xiao
it shows the command has been executed
so the previous script also work but just have no output in the screen
