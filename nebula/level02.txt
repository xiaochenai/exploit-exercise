getenv

The getenv() function searches the environment list to find the environment variable name, and returns a pointer to the corresponding value string.

ref:http://linux.die.net/man/3/getenv

what the file does is:
1. get a environment variable called USER
2. assign it to buffer
3. call system call to execute buffer

ideas:
set buffer to /bin/getflag

next point is how to set environment variable USER

google "how to set en........ in linux"

http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/set-environment-variable-linux/

export USER=/bin/getflag

however this does not work
the output is: 
	about to call system("/bin/echo /bin/getflag is coll")
	/bin/getflag is coll

obviously the '/bin/getflag' is work as a string here
however we want it to be a command
so add ';' in the front to seperate
export USER=;/bin/getflag
but it gives "getflag is executing on a non-flag account, this doesnt count"
use ls -l to find the file permission of /home/flag02/flag02
it should be flag02
...to be continued

about the permission:

	s - This indicated the setuid/setgid permissions. This is not set displayed in the special permission part of the permissions display, but is represented as a s in the read portion of the owner or group permissions.
	Setuid/Setgid Special Permissions

	The setuid/setguid permissions are used to tell the system to run an executable as the owner with the owner\'s permissions.

so how to change permissions
TO DO


	

it should be 
export USER=";/bin/getflag"

or

USER=";/bin/getflag"

; in shell
A ';' or <newline> terminator shall cause the preceding AND-OR list to be executed sequentially; an '&' shall cause asynchronous execution of the preceding AND-OR list.
