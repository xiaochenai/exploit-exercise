srand: initialize random number generato

getenv:
char *getenv(const char *name);
searches the envionment list to find the environment variable name, and returns a pointoer to the corresponding value string.

getpid:
get the process identification

open man page:
http://linux.die.net/man/3/open
	
unlink:
delete a name and possibly the file it refers to

key = length & 0xff; //truncate the key to 8 bits

strncmp:
<0	the first character that does not match has a lower value in str1 than in str2
0	the contents of both strings are equal
>0	the first character that does not match has a greater value in str1 than in str2

fgets:
char * fgets ( char * str, int num, FILE * stream );
Reads characters from stream and stores them as a C string into str until (num-1) characters have been read or either a newline or the end-of-file is reached, whichever happens first.

A newline character makes fgets stop reading, but it is considered a valid character by the function and included in the string copied to str.

A terminating null character is automatically appended after the characters copied to str.

atoi:
Parses the C-string str interpreting its content as an integral number, which is returned as a value of type int.


  if(fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin) == NULL) {
      errx(1, "reading from stdin");
  }

  if(strncmp(line, CL, strlen(CL)) != 0) {
      errx(1, "invalid header");
  }
  //read in the length of command, the newline character is inclueded 

  Test case:
  	Content-Length: 8
  	123
  	123

  	Content-Length: 8
  	12
  	12
  	1
Content-Length: cmd
line is what user entered
length = cmd (if cmd is numeric otherwise is 0)
fread:
http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fread/
size_t fread ( void * ptr, size_t size, size_t count, FILE * stream );
Reads an array of count elements, each one with a size of size bytes, from the stream and stores them in the block of memory specified by ptr.
THe return value:
	The total number of elements successfully read is returned
So the return value of fread in line 71 will always be 1

Line 71: fread(buf, length, 1, stdin)
read in length characters and return 1
