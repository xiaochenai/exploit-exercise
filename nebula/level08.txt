There is a file end with .pcap
It can be open with WireShark or tcpdump

Wireshark is not installed
tcpdump is installed
So I try to use tcpdump 


However the output of tcpdum is too crazy. We have no way to figure out the password from this (but I believe there is a way with tcpdump to figure out the password If knowing how to use tcpdump well)

After reviewing parts of others' solution, we know the *.pcap can be transferred to another machine use nc commnad.
use nc command to transfer *.pcap to another machine which have wireshark installed

local: nc targetIP targetPort < *.pcap
target: nc -l  Port > *.pcap

 transfer the file to BT5R3
then use wireshark to open the file and follow the TCP stream

the password is backdoor...00Rm8.ate
however it is not correct
look at RAW/ASCII and then the Hex Dump, it is obvious that:
The string in blue is what tranmitted from server to user
the string in red is what transmitted from user to server

start from  000000B2  6C
it is obvious that user typed in l
then 
			000000B3  65

6C is l and e is 65	in hdex
so let's look at the Hex value of what user typed in
backdoor are all in their correct ASCII hex value
but the three . is 7f which is del
00Rm8 in their correct ASCII value
one 7f is del
ate
one 0d is carriage return
so the password should be backd00Rmate
it is the correct password
