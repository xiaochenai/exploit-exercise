'ls'
nothing listed

'ls -la'
have something listed

'cd .ssh'
permission denied

'cd .backup'
success

others are files with only read permission

find a compressed file in backup

tar ref: http://www.computerhope.com/unix/utar.htm
try to un-compress it use 'tar xf backup-19072011.tgz'

permission denied

'ls -al'
the first line shows our permission in current directory

try to un-compress the file to /tmp
'tar xf backup-19072011.tgz -C /tmp/'

go to tmp file
'ls -al' find a .ssh folder
'cd .ssh'
'ls -al'
there are several files in this directory
	authorized_keys
	id_rsa
	id_rsa.pub
looks like the ssh keys but the question is how can we utilize this

try 'ssh flag05'
can not find host or serve

review the answer
the host should be 'flag05@localhost'
and for ssh follow this http://my.oschina.net/aiguozhe/blog/33994

man cp
-r copy recursively, this is usually used to copy directory
